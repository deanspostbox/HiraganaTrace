This repository lets GitHub build an APK for you (no Android Studio needed).

## Steps

2. Create a **new repository** named `HiraganaTrace`.
3. Upload everything in this folder to that repository.
4. On GitHub, go to the **Actions** tab.
5. Click **Build APK** on the left.
6. Click **Run workflow** (green button).
7. Wait a few minutes. When it's done, open the run and scroll to **Artifacts**.
8. Download **HiraganaTrace-debug-apk** and unzip it. Inside you'll find **app-debug.apk**.
9. Copy the APK to your Android phone and install it (enable install from unknown sources if asked).

Enjoy!
