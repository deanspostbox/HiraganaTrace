# HiraganaTrace (Beginner Friendly, v2)

This repo builds an APK using GitHub Actions — no Android Studio needed.

## Steps
1. Make a new GitHub repo called `HiraganaTrace`.
2. Upload the **contents of the `HiraganaTrace` folder** from this ZIP into the repo.
3. Go to the **Actions** tab → **Build APK** → **Run workflow**.
4. After it finishes, download the **HiraganaTrace-debug-apk** artifact → `app-debug.apk` is inside.
5. Copy the APK to your phone and install it.
